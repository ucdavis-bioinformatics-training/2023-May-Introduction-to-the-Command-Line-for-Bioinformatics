Get off to a good start in bioinformatics with this three-part online workshop in the use of the command line interface. This workshop lays the foundation for successful bioinformatics experiments, including RNA-Seq, single cell RNA-Seq, genome assembly, GWAS, variant analysis, epigenetics and more.

This workshop consists of three half-day sessions, combining lecture and exercises in a survey of the basics of the command line for bioinformatics. Completion of this material will allow participants to get the most out of our other experiment-centric workshops. We recommend this course for all beginners.

Participants must have a Mac, a Linux machine, or Windows 10.
